# Remote learning at SBHS, and why it needs to continue

#### **John Yang** - *Junior, South Brunswick High School*

The COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed our lives overnight. In March, South Brunswick Schools closed and began using remote learning. 

Online schooling began using an asynchronous model, meaning that teachers and students were not required to follow a set schedule of classes. This was the best option at the time, as it was the most logistically simple solution that still allowed students to continue learning at an acceptable level. It also took into account students who needed to share electronic devices with others, and also people whose internet connections would not be able to handle the load of online meetings. Everyone’s situation was totally unique, and the asynchronous model worked, especially since it began on short notice. 

In most cases, students just needed to submit an assignment by the end of the day to be marked present. Different teachers handled it differently. For some, a worksheet was posted on Google Classroom for students to complete, and that was it. Many resources were available to students, such as online textbooks, internet websites, etc. Other teachers recorded lectures and screencasts and posted them for their students to watch, and then complete a related worksheet. For others, online meetings were set up for students to join and interact with their teachers real time, whether for direct instruction or to ask questions. 

The issue of integrity arose. When it came time for assessments, how would teachers ensure the integrity of the exams? Was there any way to prevent students from cheating? Granted, students cheat during in person schooling too, but remote learning presented an easy way for students to give themselves an unfair advantage. Most mitigation efforts were not effective (using Zoom, giving a limited time window, etc). Some teachers made exams open-book, and some got rid of exams entirely. 

School and district leadership made the move - courses would be graded on a pass/fail system for the remainder of the school year. As long as students put a sufficient amount of effort into their work, they would be given a pass, and 4th quarter grades would not count towards overall GPAs. Although it was a patchy band-aid solution to the problem, it was enough to push everyone through to the end of the year, where there still was no sign of the pandemic ending. Cases and deaths kept increasing. Drive-by graduations celebrated the seniors, who were never able to experience the rites of passage that most go through in a typical year. Nobody had any idea what the summer might look like, but there was a strong sense of hope that we would be able to come back to school in the fall. 

As summer passed, that hope slowly but steadily diminished, and it became clear that we would not be going back to in person schooling for a very long time. The first days of school were again nothing like we might have ever expected, but in a different way. 

This year, remote learning began in a synchronous model. Students now had to follow a set schedule and join Zoom meetings for classes. Although there were several unknowns, we were optimistic and ready to make the most of our situation. 

However, uncertainty reigned. Teachers weren’t completely sure how they might go about teaching their students over the internet, and students weren’t sure how they might learn. My teachers employed a wide variety of tools - screen shares, videos, breakout rooms, etc. And for the most part, the system worked. Students were given a good learning environment, and have many incentives to put in effort and ultimately learn. 

Back in August, plans were proposed to help ensure a safe and effective reopening, when it was possible. Parents could choose whether they were willing to send their kids to school or have them stay home. In early October, the planned date for hybrid reopening was set for November 16th, and parents were again given the same choice, via a survey on Genesis. 

On Thursday, October 15th, a Board of Education meeting was held to discuss school reopening plans. It had turned out that less than a quarter (25%) of students were open to using the hybrid education model, and the rest wanted to stay virtual. Of course, the survey results did not include those who did not fill out the survey by the deadline. It was made clear that if parents did not fill out the survey again, their response from August would be used. 

The decision of the Board of Education was to delay the beginning of the hybrid model until January in response to low demand. This sparked massive outrage among the parents in the minority, who wanted to send their children to school. Fiery discussions ensued. 

Those wanting schools to reopen made several arguments, relating to both education and covid. Many of those arguments were illogical or even entirely unfounded. 

From a high school perspective, synchronous remote learning has provided high quality educational opportunities. Live instruction has provided teachers and students to directly interact, and gives teachers a chance to gauge each student’s understanding of the material. Assessments have been given, taking some precautions against cheating. The threat of integrity violations is usually enough to deter students who might be tempted to cheat. Even during in-person instruction, students need to take charge of their own learning. Students choose whether or not they want to learn. If a student understands the value of the educational opportunities, they will surely take full advantage of said opportunities. The cheating argument doesn’t hold - students who cheat are always going to cheat. You can try to stop them, but there’s only so much you can do. Thus, it’s not worth it to trade the health and safety of a student’s family and community for an attempt to limit cheating, which they will do anyway. 

Some concerned parents have mentioned that students will not graduate in time. Even during our pass/fail system last year, credits were still awarded to qualified students, and they are still on track to fulfilling graduation requirements. 

In our current remote learning model, students who are in most need of special help are having in-person instruction. These include some students with IEPs, students with autism, life skills students, etc. The school district and Board of Education have understood the importance of in-person education for these students and have taken the right measures to ensure they are safe and learning<sup>[1](#one)</sup>. However, other students with IEPs and some who otherwise have special needs are not currently learning in-person right now. I trust that the appropriate officials and case managers have deemed it acceptable for those students to be in remote learning right now, although it would be beneficial for them to learn in person. A good case could be made for bringing such students back to in-person or hybrid learning. 

The argument that COVID-19 does not spread in schools is dangerous and wrong. In New Jersey, 22 COVID-19 outbreaks have been linked to in-school transmission, resulting in 83 cases<sup>[2](#two)</sup>. It is also dangerous to believe that children do not contract COVID-19. As of October 3, 2020, 277,285 children ages 5-17 have tested positive for COVID-19<sup>[3](#three)</sup>. At the end of the day, putting children, teachers, and staff inside small classrooms with poor ventilation for several hours is not a good idea. Studies have suggested that even 6 feet of social distancing could be insufficient in preventing the spread of COVID-19<sup>[4](#four),[5](#five)</sup>. As is currently proposed, alternating two groups of students with the same teachers is unsafe. It is possible for teachers to become infected with COVID-19 and spread it to many of their students. In addition, anecdotal evidence when considering schools and COVID-19 is misleading as situations across the country are dynamic and fall into unique environments that can’t necessarily be compared with each other. Furthermore, COVID-19 cases are on the rise in almost every state. Bringing students and teachers in for in-person instruction would be a rash decision that will eventually have tragic consequences. Finding COVID-19 cases in school is bound to happen if in-person instruction begins too early. We may have become desensitized to the threat of COVID-19, but we must remember that it is a deadly disease that has already killed over 220,000 Americans. 

Now, take a moment to consider teachers, who have been working tirelessly since March to make remote learning as smooth and effective as possible. With the synchronous model, I have observed firsthand the technical difficulties teachers are facing, without even having students in the classroom. Simultaneously, teachers must teach, monitor the chat for questions, engage students, and manage their digital classrooms. Adding students in person will greatly increase the workload of teachers, who will now need to find a way to provide equal opportunities for both in-person and remote students, while also enforcing mask-wearing and hygiene practices. 

Finally, consider the logistical nightmare that hybrid learning will present. Buses, food services, paraprofessionals, custodians, sanitation, and many more aspects of hybrid learning must be considered and carefully organized to run smoothly and safely. Educationally, some students’ classes and schedules will need to be changed, which will break down the relationships they have already formed with their teachers and classmates. Will we do all this for less than 25% of the students in our district? When does a 25% minority win over such a large majority?

In conclusion, remote learning has its pros and cons. For some students such as those with IEPs and individualized educational needs, hybrid learning should be considered to set them up for success. For other students, health and safety should not be sacrificed for the few benefits they might gain from hybrid learning.
